              The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. It has been in continuous production since 1964, making it the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its sixth generation, it ranks as the fifth-best-selling Ford car nameplate. The Mustang is the namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment and was originally developed as a line of highly styled sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines. It was initially distinguished by its 'long hood, short deck' proportions.

              Originally projected to sell 100,000 vehicles annually, the 1965 Mustang exceeded expectations, becoming the most successful vehicle launch since the 1927 Model A. It was introduced on April 17, 1964, just 16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda. In its first year, over 400,000 units were sold, and within two years of its launch, the one-millionth Mustang was sold. In August 2018, Ford celebrated the production of the 10-millionth Mustang, mirroring the first 1965 model. The milestone vehicle was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible equipped with a V8 engine.

          The success of the Mustang launch led to multiple competitors from other American manufacturers, including the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird (1967), AMC Javelin (1968), and Dodge Challenger (1970). The Mustang also had a significant influence on the designs of coup√©s worldwide, contributing to the marketing of the Toyota Celica and the Ford Capri in the United States (the latter, by Lincoln-Mercury). In 1967, the Mercury Cougar was launched as a higher-trim version of the Mustang, and during the 1970s, it was repositioned as a personal luxury car.

          For 1965 to 2004, the Mustang shared chassis commonality with other Ford model lines, remaining rear-wheel drive throughout its production. From 1965 to 1973, the Mustang was derived from the 1960 Ford Falcon compact. From 1974 to 1978, the Mustang (denoted Mustang II) was a longer-wheelbase version of the Ford Pinto. From 1979 to 2004, the Mustang shared its Fox platform chassis with 14 other Ford vehicles (becoming the final one to use the Fox architecture). Since 2005, Ford has produced two generations of the Mustang, each using a distinct platform unique to the model line.
