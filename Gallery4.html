          The fourth-generation Ford Mustang, produced by the American manufacturer Ford, was available for the model years 1994 through 2004. In 1994, the Ford Mustang underwent its first major redesign in fifteen years, with its introduction in November 1993 and official launch on December 9, 1993.

          The design, internally code-named 'SN-95' by Ford, was built on an updated version of the Fox platform, marking the final Ford vehicle underpinned with this platform. It incorporated styling by Bud Magaldi that drew from stylistic elements of the classic Mustangs. While a convertible made a return, the previous notchback and hatchback body styles were discontinued in favor of a single fastback coupe body style.

          Before the launch of the redesigned Mustang, a two-seater show car was designed by Darrell Behmer and Bud Magali. This car, named the Mustang Mach III, made its debut at the 1993 North American International Auto Show in Detroit and offered a preview of the new production Mustang's design. The Mach III boasted a supercharged 4.6 L DOHC V8 engine with 450 hp (336 kW; 456 PS). Although this particular engine didn't make it into production, it foreshadowed the future use of Ford's Modular V8 in the Mustang, including the eventual use of a supercharged 4.6 L V8.
