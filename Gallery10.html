        <p>
          John Najjar was an American designer and executive stylist at Ford Motor Company, credited for co-designing the first prototype of the Ford Mustang, known as the Ford Mustang I, with Philip T. Clark.

        <p>
          While working as a machinist there, he was approached by Henry Ford during a plant tour who asked him if he enjoyed his work. Najjar's response that he would "rather be drawing cars" led to an invitation for him to contribute his talents to Ford's newly established Design Center.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Advanced Styling Studio developed the 1962 Ford Mustang I concept car, named in honor of his admiration for the North American P-51 Mustang fighter plane. His design contributions spanned decades and included the M4A3 Sherman tank and B-24 bomber in the 1940s, the 1957-58 Lincoln Continentals, the Mercury XM-800, and the LevaCar concept.
