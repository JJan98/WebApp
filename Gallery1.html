          The first-generation Ford Mustang was manufactured by Ford from March 1964 until 1973. The introduction of the Mustang created a new class of automobile known as the 'pony car.' The Mustang's styling, with its long hood and short deck, proved wildly popular and inspired a host of competitors

          It was initially introduced on April 17, 1964, as a hardtop and convertible, with the fastback version becoming available for sale in August 1964. At the time of its introduction, the Mustang, which shared its platform with the Falcon, was categorized within the compact car segment.

          With each revision, the Mustang experienced increases in overall dimensions and engine power. The 1971 model marked a significant departure from its predecessors. Despite an initial surge in sales, there was a steady decline, prompting Ford to work on a new generation of the Mustang. As the 1973 oil crisis emerged, Ford was prepared, as they had already designed the smaller Mustang II for the 1974 model year. Notably, this new car shared no common components with its predecessors.
