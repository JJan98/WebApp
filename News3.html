          The Ford Mustang is the best-selling sports car for the sixth year in
          a row
        </header>

        <p>
          Ford released the numbers for both the fourth quarter and for the 2020
          year and it revealed that Mustang sales totaled 61,090 for the year,
          marking its sixth straight year as Americaâ€™s best-selling sports car.
          Mustang also finished the final quarter on total sales of 13,453 cars.
          At retail, Mustang sales were up 14.8 percent for the quarter.
          Combined Q4 retail sales of Shelby GT350 and GT500 increased 36
          percent, with retail sales up 14 percent for the year.

          I wrote a eulogy and tribute to the GT350 as one of the best Mustangs Ford has produced in a long time. It's being discontinued, and the Mustang Mach 1 will replace it in the stable. Ford will also continue to produce the Mustang GT500.
        </p>

        <p>
          Car sales, in general, have significantly declined across the board due to the pandemic. That's a natural consequence. Therefore, Mustang having the lowest number of units sold ever is not as dire as it may sound. In truth, Mustang sales are only down by 15 percent compared to the previous year when Ford sold 72,489 units.
        </p>

        <p>
          But you can't dismiss the significant drop in sales for the Mustang and the entire muscle car/sports car segment. It's a bit like a dying breed.
