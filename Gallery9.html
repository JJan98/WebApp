          At launch, three engines were available: a standard aluminum 3.7 L "Cyclone" V6, an optional 2.3 L EcoBoost turbocharged, direct-injected I4, or a 5.0 L "Coyote" V8.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 2.3 L EcoBoost engine is new to the Mustang, having made its debut in the 2015 model year Lincoln MKC crossover. This four-cylinder engine comes with various improvements over its earlier versions. The introduction of the 2.3 Ecoboost engine also marks the return of a 4-cylinder engine to the Mustang, a configuration that was standard in cars produced from 1974 to 1993, as well as in the 'SVO' turbocharged models from 1984 to 1986.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2018, the 5.0 L Coyote V8 engine received updates as part of the 2018 (Gen. 3) improvements. These updates included revised intake runners, larger valves, and dual injection, which utilizes both direct injection and port injection. This design enables it to run on 87 octane (AKI) gasoline with a high 12:1 compression ratio. Additionally, the cylinders are now lined with a thinner plasma coating, replacing the thicker and heavier traditional cylinder sleeves. This change results in a slight displacement increase, going from 4,951cc (302 cubic inches) to 5,038cc (307 cubic inches).
