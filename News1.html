          Reviewer prefers V8 engine over 2020 Ford Mustang EcoBoost HPP
        </header>

        <p>
          After spending a week with a fully-loaded 2020 Ford Mustang HPP, Travis from SVT Performance couldn't make a case for the handling-oriented spec over the GT option equipped with the Coyote V8 engine and Performance Pack Level 2. It's worth noting that the GT PPL2 was discontinued late in 2020.

        <p>
          The Blue Oval discontinued the ultimate version of the GT after introducing the Mach 1, which now holds the title of the king of Coyote-powered ponies. It's worth noting that the Mach 1 also takes the place of the Shelby GT350 and GT350R, which is a bit disappointing given the loss of the Voodoo flat-plane crankshaft motor.

        <p>
          However, there is a bit of an elephant in the room. Ford is charging $4,995 for the High-Performance Package, which generates 332 horsepower and 350 pound-feet (475 Nm) of torque. It's worth noting that the Focus RS used to produce 350 horsepower, so it appears that someone has intentionally limited the HPP for some reason. Regarding the Velocity Blue example shown in the following videos, the sticker price could be described as somewhat inflated at $43,000.

          Capable of delivering 270 horsepower and 335 pound-feet (454 Nm) of torque to the rear wheels, the reason this HPP is considerably more expensive compared to a V8-engined model is the array of options designed to enhance handling and daily driving. Among these options, the two-door coupe from Flat Rock, Michigan is equipped with the Equipment Group 201A priced at $2,200, the EcoBoost Handling Package at $1,195, and Recaro body-hugging bucket seats at $1,995.

          The verdict? Well, it’s pretty obvious from the headline, isn’t it? As Travis from SVT Performance put it, 'I do like this car, but I just don’t think it’s for me.'
