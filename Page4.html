              Changes include a widened body by 1.5 inches, a lower body height of 1.4 inches, a trapezoidal grille, and a 2.75-inch lower decklid, along with new color options. The passenger volume has been increased to 84.5 cubic feet, while the wheelbase remains at 8 ft. 11.1 in. (107.1 inches). There are three engine options available: a newly developed 2.3 L EcoBoost 310 hp four-cylinder, introduced to target high-tariff global markets like China, a 3.7 L 300 hp V6, and a 5.0 L Coyote 435 hp V8. These engines are paired with either a Getrag six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters.

          A new independent rear suspension (IRS) system was developed specifically for the new model. It also became the first version designed for factory right-hand drive, intended for export to be sold through Ford's new car dealerships in right-hand drive markets. During this model year, left-hand drive versions were expanded to new export markets.
