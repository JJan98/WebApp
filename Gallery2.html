          The second-generation Ford Mustang, marketed as the Ford Mustang II, is a two- or three-door, four-passenger, front-engine/rear-drive pony car produced by Ford from 1973 to 1978. Introduced in September 1973 for the 1974 model year, the Mustang II coincided with the 1973 oil embargo and subsequent fuel shortages.

          The second generation, 490 pounds lighter and almost 19 inches shorter than the 1973 Mustang, was based on the subcompact Pinto platform. It featured a unique unibody construction with an isolated front suspension and engine mount subframe, while sharing only a limited number of chassis and driveline components. The steering was also enhanced compared to the previous generation, employing a rack-and-pinion design.

        <p>
          Named Motor Trend's 1974 Car of the Year and achieving over 1.1 million sales during its four years of production, the Mustang II is notable for its marketing prescience and robust sales figures. However, it is also criticized by certain enthusiasts for departing from essential aspects of the Mustang heritage. In a retrospective after 40 years since its introduction, it has been described as emblematic of the Malaise era.
