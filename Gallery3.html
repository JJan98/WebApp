          The third-generation Mustang, produced by Ford from 1978 to 1993, is commonly referred to as the Fox Body Mustang due to its construction on Ford's Fox platform.

          Throughout its production life, the third-generation Mustang evolved through various sub-models, trim levels, and drivetrain combinations. In 1987, it underwent updates, and there were plans to replace it with a front-wheel-drive Mazda platform. However, due to consumer opinion and demand, company executives decided to keep the rear-wheel-drive Mustang, while the front-wheel-drive version was renamed the Ford Probe.

          Enthusiasts categorize this generation into two segments: the 1979–1986 cars, distinguished by their quad headlight arrangement, and the 1987–1993 cars, known for their aerodynamic composite headlamps and front fascia styling. Production came to a close with the introduction of the fourth-generation Mustang (SN-95) for the 1994 model year.
